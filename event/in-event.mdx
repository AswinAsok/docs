Similar to the **Glance View** in the **Overview Section**, this section displays:
- The check-in count against total registrations, split by category.
- For multi-day check-in events, the check-ins for the current day are also displayed separately.

### Check-In Trends (Line Graph)
- The first graph is a **line graph** showing the number of check-ins per hour for the day.
- If the event spans multiple days, multiple lines will be present on the graph, each representing a different day.
- The check-in counts are also displayed below the graph in a readable numeric format.

### Category-Wise Check-Ins (Bar Graph)
- The second graph is a **bar graph** displaying the total number of check-ins per category.
- This is an **aggregate graph**, meaning it does not categorize data by event date.

## Recent Check-Ins
- A list of the most recent check-ins, displaying guest names in real time.
- A **welcome banner** automatically pops up when a new check-in occurs.

## Unique Room Number
For venues with multiple check-in points, this feature ensures organized guest check-ins:

### Adding Room Numbers

</Frame>


- Click on the **Add Room Number** button to add a room number.
- In the pop-up, enter the **room number**.
- Click **Add** to save the room number.

### How It Works

1. **Multiple Monitors Setup**
   - Two separate monitors can be placed in hallways leading to check-in areas.
   - Each monitor corresponds to a specific check-in hall.

2. **Room Number Assignment**
   - While scanning, the volunteer can enter the room number.
   - The system will display the room number on the monitor.
   - The welcome banners are displayed accordingly, ensuring guests are guided to the correct check-in area.
