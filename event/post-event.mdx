## Post-Event Emails
This section enables the initiation of post-event emails, categorized into two types:

### Participant Emails
- Sends the **AfterEventThankYou** email to all attendees who checked in at the event venue on at least one of the event days.

### Non-Participant Emails
- Sends the **AfterEventSorry** email to individuals who registered and were shortlisted but did not check in for the event.

## Upload Event Media
Organizers can upload the following post-event resources:
- **Event Photos**
- **Event Video Link**
- **Drive Link**

These uploaded resources will be displayed on the **public event page**, as the event registration form is no longer active.
