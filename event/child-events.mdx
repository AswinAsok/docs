## Creating a Child Event

<Frame>
<img

  src="/images/event/childEvents/createChildEvent.png"
/>
</Frame>

1. Click on the **Create Child Event** button at the top right.
2. In the modal that opens, enter the child event name and select its type:
   - **Sub-Event**
   - **Feedback Event**
3. Once created, the organizer is directed to the event page of the newly created sub-event.
4. The organizer can configure the sub-event just like the parent event.

## Guest Registration for Child Events
- Guests must be registered in the **main event** before registering for the sub-event.
- They must log in using the **email** they used for the parent event.
- Since they have already provided details such as name and email for the parent event, this information is automatically mapped to their child-event submission, eliminating the need to re-enter details.
