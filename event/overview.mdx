### **Event Glance**
The top section of the dashboard displays a real-time breakdown of your event’s registration status:
- **Total Registrations** – View the total number of attendees registered.
- **Target Registrations** – Set a target number of attendees to aim for.
- **Shortlisted Attendees** – See how many attendees are confirmed.
- **Unclaimed Tickets** – If a guest has purchased multiple tickets but hasn’t assigned them yet, those tickets will appear as unclaimed.

This section gives organizers a clear overview of event progress at a glance.

## Recent Registrations

The **Recent Registrations** section updates dynamically, showing the last 10 guests who registered.  
Organizers can:
- Click on any guest’s name to view detailed attendee information.
- Monitor registration trends in real time.

This helps in quickly identifying new registrants and ensuring smooth event check-ins.

## Host Management

The **Host Management** section allows event organizers to add and manage team members with different roles and permissions.

<div style={{ maxWidth: '600px', margin: '0' }}>
  | Role       | Description |
  |------------|-------------|
  | **Owner**  | The event creator with full control over all aspects, including settings, payments, and deleting the event. |
  | **Admin**  | Can manage attendees, ticketing, check-ins, and event settings but cannot delete the event. |
  | **Editor** | Has access to edit event details, update attendee info, and modify email templates. |
  | **Viewer** | Can only view specific sections of the event dashboard with limited access (e.g., finance is restricted). |
  | **Volunteer** | Responsible for scanning attendee QR codes at check-in but has no access to event settings. |
</div>

These roles help ensure smooth event operations and clear delegation of tasks.

### How to Add a Host

Follow these steps to add team members to your event:

1. Navigate to the **Host Management** section in your event dashboard
2. Click the **Add Host** button in the top-right corner
3. Enter the team member's email address
4. Select the appropriate role from the dropdown menu
5. Click **Add Host**

> If you want the host's name to be visible on the registration page, enable the host public toggle.

The team member will receive an email confirmation, and they can log in to their account to access the event dashboard.

> **Note:** You can modify a team member's role or revoke access at any time by selecting their profile in the Host Management section and updating their permissions.
