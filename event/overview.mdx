/>
</Frame>

- **Total Registrations** – View the total number of attendees registered.
- **Target Registrations** – Set a target number of attendees to aim for. By default this is set to 250, which is the maximum number of attendees allowed in a single free event. 
- **Shortlisted Attendees** – See how many attendees are Shortlisted for the event by the organizer.
- **Unclaimed Tickets** – If a guest has purchased multiple tickets but, has not claimed them, this number will show how many tickets are unclaimed.

<Info>
For multi-ticket purchases, event settings determine whether all tickets share one submission or each requires separate information. For individual submissions, the purchaser must share claim links with guests. Unclaimed tickets appear in a dedicated section.
</Info>

This section gives organizers a clear overview of event progress at a glance.


## Recent Registrations

The **Recent Registrations** section updates dynamically, showing the last 10 guests who registered. Organizers can:
- Click on any guest’s name to view detailed attendee information.
- Monitor registration trends in real time.

This helps in quickly identifying new registrants and ensuring smooth event check-ins.

## Host Management

The **Host Management** section allows event organizers to add and manage team members with different roles and permissions.

<div style={{ maxWidth: '600px', margin: '0' }}>
