## Code Prefix

- You can manually update the event ticket **code prefix** (default: `MMP`).
- Each ticket code consists of the **prefix** followed by a set of **unique numbers**.
- You can define the **number of digits** in the unique code sequence.

## User Count

- Set the **number of users per ticket** who can check in with the same ticket.

## Category

- Assign a **category** to a ticket (e.g., `Gold`, `Diamond`, `Silver`, etc.). This will be used for grouping the tickets in the ticket selection at the registration page.

## Commission

- Set a **commission amount** that can be given to the person who sells the ticket.
- This works in conjunction with the **Referral Code** field.

## Allowed Date

- If the ticket is valid only for a certain period, specify the **valid dates**.

## Ticket Sale Period

- **Start Date:** The date and time when ticket sales begin.
- **End Date:** The date and time when ticket sales close.

## Conditional Ticket Display

- Tickets can be shown or hidden based on **form field values** provided by the user.
- Example: If a ticket is available only for students but a user selects **Professional** in the form, the student ticket will be **hidden** from that user.

<Info>
  Use conditional display settings to personalize the ticketing experience based on user input.
