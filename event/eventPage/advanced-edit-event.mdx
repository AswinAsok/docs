## Show Tickets First
By default, on the event registration page, the event form is shown first. This setting allows changing the order so that tickets are shown first.

## Allow Team Registrations
If the event supports team registrations, such as a hackathon, this toggle can be enabled.

- **Min. Members:** Once enabled, this input appears, allowing you to set the minimum number of members required for a team.
- **Max. Members:** Similar to Min. Members, this input allows setting the maximum number of members per team.
- **Per User Ticket:** If in a team there are 5 members, then each of them should take seperate tickets. If not enabled a single person can but the Max. Members ticket and all the members can be registered under that ticket.

## Allow Multi Ticket
If the event allows multiple tickets to be purchased in a single transaction, this toggle can be enabled.

### Grouped Tickets
If the event has multiple tickets, this toggle allows grouping them together. There will multiple tickets against a single transaction and there will just a single user submmission
for all the tickets.

## Enable Checkout Scan
Similar to the check-in scan, if the organizer wishes to track check-outs as well, this toggle can be enabled. And a button will be visbile on the Scan QR page to check out the user.

## Thank You Page
By default, a modal appears when a user registers for an event. If the organizer prefers to show a dedicated page instead, this toggle can be used.

<Info>
When using the modal, the user can close it and the registration form reloads. With this toggle enabled, the form does not reload as the user is redirected to a new page.

## Enable Randomizer
If the organizer wants to randomly select participants from the checked-in attendees for competitions or Q&A sessions, this toggle can be enabled.

## Multi-Day Check-In
For events spanning multiple days, this toggle allows guests to use the same ticket for subsequent days without needing to re-register. This is useful for events like hackathons or conferences where attendees may need to check in on different days.

## Check-In Confirmation
When enabled, organizers can add a list of form fields using a multi-select. During check-in, these fields will be displayed for confirmation. This is useful for events where the organizer needs to verify specific details about the attendee before allowing them to enter the venue.

## Add Custom Mail Alias
If enabled, intead of the default mail alias which is noreply@makemypass.com the eventName@makemypass.com will be used to send the mail to the attendess.

## Print Ticket
If physical ticket printing is required at the event venue, this toggle must be enabled.

### Remote Printing
We support remote printing, where scanning happens away from the printing counter. Once scanned, the ticket is queued at the print desk based on a unique printer id, so it is ready by the time the attendee reaches the counter.

## Edit Ticket Code
If ticket codes need to be edited after issuing, this toggle can be enabled. The "Edit Guest" form on the guest page can then be used to modify ticket codes.

<Info>
Once edited, the new ticket code will be shown on the user's "View Ticket" page.
</Info>

## Allow Resubmission
For events involving shortlisting, organizers can allow users to correct and resubmit their applications for approval by enabling this toggle.

## Follow-up Message
This input allows entering a message that will be shown to users either in the modal or on a new page, depending on the "Thank You Modal" setting after they have registered for the event.
