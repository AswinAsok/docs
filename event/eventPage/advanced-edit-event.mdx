## Show Tickets First
By default, on the event registration page, the event form is shown first. This setting allows changing the order so that tickets are shown first using this toggle.

## Allow Team Registrations
If the event supports team registrations, such as a hackathon, this toggle can be enabled.

- **Min. Members:** Once enabled, this input appears, allowing you to set the minimum number of members required for a team.
- **Max. Members:** Similar to Min. Members, this input allows setting the maximum number of members per team.
- **Per User Ticket:** Individual tickets per team member.

## Allow Multi Ticket
If the event allows multiple tickets to be purchased in a single transaction, this toggle can be enabled.

### Grouped Tickets
If the event has multiple tickets, this toggle allows grouping them together. There will multiple tickets against a single transaction and there will just a single user submmission
for all the tickets.

## Enable Checkout Scan
Similar to the check-in scan, if the organizer wishes to track check-outs as well, this toggle can be enabled.

## Thank You Page
By default, a modal appears when a user registers for an event. If the organizer prefers to show a dedicated page instead, this toggle can be used.

<Info>
When using the modal, the user can close it and the registration form reloads. With this toggle enabled, the form does not reload.

## Enable Randomizer
If the organizer wants to randomly select participants from the checked-in attendees for competitions or Q&A sessions, this toggle can be enabled.

## Multi-Day Check-In
For events spanning multiple days, this toggle allows guests to use the same ticket for subsequent days.

## Check-In Confirmation
When enabled, organizers can add a list of form fields as a multi-select. During check-in, these fields will be displayed for confirmation.

## Add Custom Mail Alias
If enabled, only the organizer can set a custom email alias instead of using the default one provided by MakeMyPass.

## Print Ticket
If physical ticket printing is required at the event venue, this toggle must be enabled.

### Remote Printing
We support remote printing, where scanning happens away from the printing counter. Once scanned, the ticket is queued at the print desk, so it is ready by the time the attendee reaches the counter.

## Edit Ticket Code
If ticket codes need to be edited after issuing, this toggle can be enabled. The "Edit Guest" form on the guest page can then be used to modify ticket codes.

<Info>
Once edited, the new ticket code will be shown on the user's "View Ticket" page.

## Allow Resubmission
For events involving shortlisting, organizers can allow users to correct and resubmit their applications for approval by enabling this toggle.

## Follow-up Message
This input allows entering a message that will be shown to users either in the modal or on a new page, depending on the "Thank You Modal" setting.

<Info>
Links to WhatsApp groups, additional instructions, etc., can be placed here.
