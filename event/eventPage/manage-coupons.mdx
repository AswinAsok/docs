> **Note:** Initially, this section is disabled if no coupons exist. Click **Add New Coupon Code** to start adding coupons.

## Adding a New Coupon

1. In the modal that opens, enter the **Coupon Code** (e.g., `DISCOUNT50`, `EARLYBIRD25`).
2. Select the **tickets** to which this coupon applies from the dropdown.
3. Enter the **discount value** (either a fixed amount or a percentage). The discount cannot exceed the original ticket price.
4. Provide a **short description** for reference.
5. Set the **Limit Usage** to restrict how many times the coupon can be used. Once the limit is reached, the coupon can no longer be redeemed.
6. Enable **Show Coupon in Form** if you want all users registering for the event to see this coupon.

> **Note:** The coupon will be **displayed** in the form but will not be **applied automatically**â€”users must apply it manually.

7. Lastly, **activate the coupon** to make it usable.
8. Once all required fields are filled, click **Save Coupon** to finalize the coupon.
