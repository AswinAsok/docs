2. Select the **tickets** to which this coupon applies from the dropdown.
3. Enter the **discount value** (either a fixed amount or a percentage). The discount cannot exceed the original ticket price.
4. Provide a **short description** for reference.
5. Set the **Limit Usage** to restrict how many times the coupon can be used. Once the limit is reached, the coupon can no longer be redeemed.

7. Lastly, **activate the coupon** to make it usable.
8. Once all required fields are filled, click **Save Coupon** to finalize the coupon.
