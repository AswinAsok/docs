## Managing Guests

The Guests section provides detailed information about attendees. Organizers can:

- View all guests who have registered or were invited manually.
- Access paginated guest data, sorted by latest registration.
- Search for guests by name or form information using the search tab.
- Apply filters to list guests based on:
  - **Check-in status** (Checked-in or Not Checked-in)
  - **Approval status** (Pending, Approved, or Rejected)

### Guest Approval Types

- **Pending** → Default state for events with waitlists.
- **Approved** → Guests manually approved by the organizer (default for non-waitlist events).
- **Rejected** → Guests who were not accepted by the organizer for any reason.

## Guest Actions and Icons

| Icon | Meaning |
|------|---------|
|<Icon icon="pen" iconType="solid" color="grey" /> | Edit guest details |
