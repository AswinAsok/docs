## Bulk Inviting Guests

To invite multiple guests at once, follow these steps:

1. Click the **Invite Guest** icon at the top-right corner of the guest table.
2. In the modal that opens, click the **Bulk Upload** button at the top-right.
3. Download the **template XLSX** file, which contains:
   - **First sheet**: Headers to be filled with guest details.
   - **Second sheet**: Field descriptions, including required fields.
4. Fill in the details directly in the sheet or create a separate XLSX file with the same format.
5. Upload the completed file using the **Upload File** option in the same modal.
6. Select the **ticket category** to be assigned to all guests in the uploaded list.
   - **Note**: Only one ticket type can be assigned per upload. For multiple ticket types, create separate XLSX files.
7. Choose whether to **send tickets and invoices** to guests immediately.
8. Click **Upload** to start the process.
