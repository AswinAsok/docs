3. Download the **template XLSX** file, which contains:
   - **First sheet**: Headers to be filled with guest details.
   - **Second sheet**: Field descriptions, including required fields.
4. Fill in the details directly in the sheet or create a separate XLSX file with the same format.
5. Upload the completed file using the **Upload File** option in the same modal.
6. Select the **ticket category** to be assigned to all guests in the uploaded list.
   - **Note**: Only one ticket type can be assigned per upload. For multiple ticket types, create separate XLSX files.
7. Choose whether to **send tickets and invoices** to guests immediately.
8. Click **Upload** to start the process.

<Tip>
It's recommended to upload the xlxs in google sheets and then download it as an xlsx file. This ensures that the file is in the correct format and avoids any potential issues with formatting or compatibility.
