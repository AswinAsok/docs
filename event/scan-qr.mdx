- If the user is already checked in, a pop-up will appear indicating that the user is already checked in.

### Venue Check-In

- Click this option to check in a user to a specific venue.
- If the user is already checked in to that venue, a pop-up will appear indicating that the user is already checked in.

## Inventory Management

### Inventory
Use this option to distribute perks/goodies to guests by scanning their QR codes at the distribution counter.

<Frame caption="when the inventory option is selected, the list of goodies will be displayed as such and the organizer can select the goodie to be distributed.">
<img

/>
</Frame>

<Note>
This distribution method is preferred if a common goodie is being distributed to the guests from a single counter. Here **goodie** is only selected once and the guest QR is scanned multiple times during distribution.
</Note>

**Steps:**
1. Click **Inventory**
2. Select **Goodie Name**
3. Scan **Guest QR**
4. Distribute Item
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 for each guest

### Individual Inventory
Unlike the **Inventory** option, this mode requires scanning the guest's QR code first to display the list of available items. The organizer can then select and claim a specific item.

<Frame caption="when the individual inventory option is selected, you can scan the guest QR code and the list of goodies will be displayed.">
<img
  className="rounded-lg shadow-md" 
  src="/images/event/scanQR/individualInventory.png"
/>
</Frame>

<Note>
This distritbution method is preferred if a number of goodies are being distributed to the guest. Here the guest QR is scanned once and the availabel goodie is selected multiple times during distribution.
</Note>

**Steps:**
1. Scan **Guest QR**
2. View available goodies
3. Select goodie to distribute
4. Confirm claim
5. Repeat steps 3 to 4 for each guest, until all goodies are claimed

### Add Bonus
If a particular goodie has not been pre-allocated, use this option to add it manually for a guest.

<Frame>
<img
  className="rounded-lg shadow-md" 
  src="/images/event/scanQR/addBonus.png"
/>
</Frame>

**Steps:**
1. Scan **Guest QR**
2. Select goodie(s)
3. Choose quantity to allocate
4. Confirm allocation

- The list of claimed goodies as well as the quantity and goodies which was allocated but not claimed will also be displayed.

After allocation, use either **Inventory** or **Individual Inventory** to distribute the goodies.

## Print Ticket

### Remote Printing

Remote Printing allows you to print tickets from a different location than the one where the QR code is scanned. This is useful for events with multiple counters or locations.

If **Remote Printing** is enabled from the [Advanced Event Settings](/event/eventPage/advanced-edit-event#remote-printing), the following options will be available:
- When a valid QR is scanned, available online printers and their IDs will be displayed.
- Select a printer ID and assign the print job to that counter.

### Normal Printing
If **Remote Printing** is not set up:
- The print window will open directly in the browser.
- The QR and other ticket details will be formatted according to the predefined schema.
- ID cards can be printed directly from the same device.

<Info>
The print schema can be only configured by us for you. Please reach out to us if you need any changes or need to set up a new schema.
</Info>

## Setup Remote Print
If **Remote Printing** is enabled in event settings, this option will be visible.

**Steps to Set Up:**
1. Select **Setup Remote Print** and open it on the printing counter.
2. On first launch, enter a unique **Printer ID**.
3. Keep the window open.
4. Once a ticket print is initiated, it will be assigned to your printer ID.
5. The print job will appear on the dashboard, allowing you to print the ticket.
